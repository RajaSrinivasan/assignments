# Assignments

This is a collection of software development assignments. I have used these as tools to 
- assess the abilities - technical skills as well as engineering discipline of new members of my team
- mentor willing mentees
- learn a new programming language for myself

## Projectlets

Each assignment is a fairly small self contained project. Depending on the skill level and interests, one can
choose to pick them up in any order. There are of course possibilities to combine some of them together.

## Programming

These have been used with a number of languages such as python, go, Ada and C#. Even if some of the examples may
suggest otherwise, the specifications are written to be language and platform agnostic. Please create an issue if you
find any system or language dependent specification.

# Direction

The goal is to string these assignments together in the form of a blog or text book. 

## Invitation

I invite fellow lifelong learners to collaborate in building up a cache of solutions to these assignments. Since they are language and platform agnostic, multiple solutions will help the community. If you have an alternate solution, please create an issue in this project with a reference to your repo.

# Working On

The book has reached a milestone - the first version is complete.
