# Projects exploring the AzureRTOS family - ThreadX, NetX, FileX etc.

1. [Blinkey](https://gitlab.com/azurertos/blinkey.git) - is a starter application generated by the wizard but with a slight twist.  
2. [Shell](https://gitlab.com/azurertos/eshell) - is basically the same except it adds support for a skeleton of a shell over UART.
