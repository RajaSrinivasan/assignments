# Projects exploring the AzureRTOS family - ThreadX, NetX, FileX etc. in conjunction with Renesas Synergy

Following projects target the Renesas S7G2 - in particular the Starter Kit. Explorations of AzureRTOS in combination with the Synergy framework.

1. [Blinkey](https://gitlab.com/azurertos/blinkey.git) - is a starter application generated by the wizard but with a slight twist.  
2. [Shell](https://gitlab.com/azurertos/eshell.git) - is basically the same except it adds support for a skeleton of a shell over UART.
3. [Messaging](https://gitlab.com/azurertos/messaging.git) - use messaging instead of global variables for communication.
4. [Check your reaction time](https://gitlab.com/azurertos/react.git) - a game of sorts similar to the Visual Field Test!
5. [Built in components - crc](https://gitlab.com/azurertos/onboard.git) - crc of different blocks of RAM. Some dynamic, others static.
