# Data Analysis

Absolutely critical in any device engineering is data analysis. Extensive internal performance data analysis is behind most successful devices. 

In this set of projects, the tool R along with RStudio is used to illustrate such applications.

An auxiliary goal is to introduce the many publicly available datasets - mostly related to healthcare.
