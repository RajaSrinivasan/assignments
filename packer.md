# Packer
## Basic Idea
You start with a blank slate or canvas. The goal is to cover this slate with circular coins - the ratio of covered vs the total area of the canvas is the score.
### Rules of the game
1. Every mouseclick or a touch results in the selection of the center of the next circle.
2. Starting from an initial value, each mouseclick creates a circle of that radius at the selected center.
3. After drawing the circle the radius is increased by the system.
4. Each circle should not intersect any other existing circle or intersect the periphery of the slate itself
